# Fault Detection and Recommendation System 🧠⚠️

This Streamlit app uses a trained YOLOv8 model to detect structural/geotechnical faults from uploaded images and provide actionable recommendations based on predefined severity, priority, and expert feedback.
## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Create and activate a Python environment (recommended)
3. Install dependencies:

## 🚀 Features

- Upload and analyze infrastructure images
- Detect faults using YOLOv8 (`best.pt` or `best.onnx`)
- Parse and interpret detections
- View structured severity, priority, and remediation suggestions
- Filter results by severity or priority
- Export results as CSV
